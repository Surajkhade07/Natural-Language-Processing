📝 NLP Practice Repository

A collection of my NLP practice code, models, and notes.
This repo captures my learning journey through core Natural Language Processing concepts, covering everything from basic text preprocessing to model building and evaluation.

🚀 What’s Inside

Text preprocessing scripts
Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization, regex cleaning, etc.

Feature engineering
Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, word embeddings, one-hot encoding.

ML & Deep Learning models
Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, LSTMs, RNNs, Transformers (as I learn them).

Study notes
Short notes for quick revision on NLP concepts, techniques, and algorithms.

Mini projects / experiments
Sentiment analysis, text classification, keyword extraction, etc.

🎯 Goals of This Repository

Build a strong foundation in NLP, step by step

Practice implementation of real-world text processing methods

Track my progress as I learn more advanced concepts

Create reusable code for future NLP projects
